# os2borgerpc-core-scripts
A suite of widely used OS2Borgerpc scripts maintained by the OS2BorgerPC project.

# Releases

Regular GitHub releases are used. For detailed instructions, see the [GitHub documentation on creating a release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release). 

When drafting a release, the "Generate release notes" feature, as mentioned in the guide, should be used to create the release notes.

## Details
- A release is a tagged (versioned) package containing all the scripts.
- Each script is versioned individually (see the respective `*.md` files for version numbers).
- Because each script is individually versioned, some scripts may remain unchanged between releases, even if the overall package is updated.
