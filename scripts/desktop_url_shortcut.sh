# Creates a customly named shortcut on the desktop for the normal user, which
# opens the URL given as an argument in the default browser.
#
# After the script has run log out or restart the computer for the changes to
# take effect.
#
# Arguments:
# 1: A boolean to decide whether to add or not. A checked box will
# add the shortcut and an unchecked will remove it
# 2: The URL to visit when clicked
# 3: The name the shortcut should have - it needs to be a valid filename!
# 4: The path to an icon. If empty an icon from the current theme is used, specified below
